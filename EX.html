<p><center><font size="5" color="blue">When I first started on working with this assignment I felt confused. It was probably due to the fact that it's been a long time since I used html again.<br>
With the guide and help of my classmates I began on remembering tha past lessons that we tackled way back then. To be honest this is a fun thing to do. It was fun searching for the codes<br>
and putting it together for it to work. I hope to learn more in our next class and lessons. </center></font></p>
